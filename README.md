# rock-paper-scissor

Aim : Learn to use introductory level javascript like if/else
      statements, basic loops, regex and function.

Will use : Loops(for or while), regex to accept any valid word,
          function to divide program, for simplicity converting 
          users input words into lowercase words,
          if/else statements to evaluate result,
          prompt to ask data from the user.

Outcome : Get familiar with javascript statements.

Working of the program: 

The game will be played between a human and a computer that will 
last 5 laps. 

The game will prompt the user to type any of the three options only 
i.e. rock, paper or scissor. This will continue for five rounds and 
at the end of each round either win, lose or draw variable will be 
incremented according to the results obtained in each round. 

In the final round, the winning and losing variables will be assessed 
according to their accumulated values, i.e. whose value is greater than 
the other. 

Case (in final round)

      win :  
            human wins if the variable win is greater than lose. 
      
      lose : 
            human loses if the variable win is less than lose.
